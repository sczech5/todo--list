List of items needed for the grocery store

# title of project
Grocery List

# description of project
This project helps the user to create a grocery list and then further edit it according to recent changes. This application can add items to the grocery list, remove items, view the list, mark an item as completed, order the items in alphabetical order, remove all items from the list, count the number of items, and exit the system all together.
This code asks the user for inputs and then stores said input in a variable to edit the user's grocery list.
To help find different functions, w3schools.com was used as a resource to perform all of the intended roles of "Grocery List".

# how to use the project
This project will ask you first which function you would like to perform by asking you for a number. The choices given indicate which number to put in for your desired function. Simply put in a number to choose the function. Depending on your chosen task, the code could ask you for an input that will be added, removed, or edited on your list. Items can be added in any case but must be referred to in that same case later on if being adjusted.
